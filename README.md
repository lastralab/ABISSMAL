<h2>Contributing to ABISSMAL as an open-access tool</h2>
We have laid out collaborative roles for contributing to ABISSMAL code development in our <a href="https://github.com/lastralab/Abissmal/wiki/1.-Project-Management">Wiki Project Management page</a>. Contributing to ABISSMAL code development requires a local version of all components of the tracking system, including sensors and other hardware. As such, we are limiting ABISSMAL code contributions to the current developers (Tania Molina, Grace Smith-Vidaurre) and future members of the Smith-Vidaurre lab who will have access to the full set of hardware needed to test code. The lab may add additional layers of data collection and processing in future releases of ABISSMAL. We recommend that others who interested in modifying ABISSMAL fork this repository as a foundation for independent customization.
