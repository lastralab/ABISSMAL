Modified from https://simonprickett.dev/using-a-break-beam-sensor-with-python-and-raspberry-pi/
This initial code works but needs to be modified to get time the beam was broken, and save these per day
I'd like 2 beam breakers per nest container, but first need to get the code working for a single sensor
Lead sensor is the first sensor from the tunnel entrance (e.g. from outside into nest chamber)
Rear sensor will be behind the lead, the closest to the nest chamber entrance)
sensor_ID = "lead"
